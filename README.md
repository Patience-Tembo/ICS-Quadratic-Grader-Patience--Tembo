# ICS-Quadratic-Grader-Patience--Tembo
A single web page that solves quadratic equations and converts numerical scores to letter grades
## Project Overview
The *ICS Quadratic Grader* is a combined program that performs *two key functions*:
1. *Quadratic Equation Solver* – Calculates the discriminant and roots of quadratic 
equations.
2. *Student Grading System* – Assigns letter grades based on numeric score ranges.
This project was developed for the *Introduction to Computer Science (ICS)* course to 
demonstrate logic building, mathematical computation, and conditional programming 
concepts.

## ⚙ Features
### Quadratic Equation Solver
- Accepts user input for coefficients *a, **b, and **c*.
- Calculates the *discriminant (b² - 4ac)*.
- Determines the *nature of the roots*:
 - Real and distinct 
 - Real and equal 
 - Complex (imaginary)
- Displays both roots of the quadratic equation.
### Grading System
- Accepts marks for multiple students.
- Calculates and displays the grade for each student.
- Counts how many students fall into each grade category.
- Provides the total number of students processed.
#### Grade Ranges
| Score Range | Grade | Description |
|--------------|--------|--------------------|
| 90 – 100 | A+ | Excellent |
| 80 – 89 | A | Very Good |
| 70 – 79 | B | Good |
| 60 – 69 | C | Satisfactory |
| 50 – 59 | D | Pass |
| 0 – 49 | F | Fail |
